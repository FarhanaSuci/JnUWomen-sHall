# 🏫 JnU Women’s Hall Management System  

A complete web-based management system designed for **Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall**, the only women’s residential hall of **Jagannath University (JnU)**.  
This project enables virtual management of hall operations — connecting **Provost, House Tutors, Students, IT Admin, and Staff** on one digital platform.

##  Problem Statement  
Managing hall activities manually often leads to inefficiency, paperwork, and communication delays between students and authorities.  
Students face difficulties reporting issues, checking notices, or applying for seat cancellations, while house tutors and provosts lack an organized virtual system to monitor hall operations.
